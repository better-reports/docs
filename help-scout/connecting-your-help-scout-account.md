# Connecting your Help Scout account



Follow these instructions to connect your Help Scout account:

* Open the [settings / data connections page](https://app.betterreports.com/settings/connections)
* Click _Add data connection_
* Under _Help Scout_, click _Connect_

You will be prompted to grant read-only access to your Help Scout account. Once confirmed, all your data will be imported and always kept up to date in the background.

{% hint style="info" %}
The initial import of your Help Scout data might take a few seconds to a few hours, depending on the amount of data. Regardless, this is a one-off operation and new data will be automatically ingested in real-time so that your reports are always up to date.
