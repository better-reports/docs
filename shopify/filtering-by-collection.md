d) Press OK. A filter is added that matches only rows for which the product belongs to the chosen collection.

To switch to another collection, remove this filter and repeat the steps above.

Note that you can add multiple collection filters. For example, you might want to filter products that are both in collection _Pants_ and collection _Summer_. Or, you could filter products that are in collection _Pants_ but **NOT** in collection _Summer_.
