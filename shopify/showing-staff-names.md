# Record staff

The staff username field is not available in the Shopify API, unless your store is on Shopify Plus (the API is restricted).

{% hint style="info" %}
If your store is on the _Shopify Plus _plan, you can skip this page and record your staff names automatically instead. See [Gift card and user reports](gift-card-and-staff-reports.md).
{% endhint %}

\
As a workaround, you can record your staff names manually in Better Reports.

a) Open [Monthly sales by POS user](https://app.betterreports.co/reports/report;id=333185519078235207?account=766488671762450086.betterreports.co\&connection=672640679920690203)

b) Click _**Record Users**_

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (44).png>)

c) A dialogue box shows up

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (45).png>)



d) Open the _**this page **_link_. _ A new tab will open.

e) Copy and paste the contents of that page in the dialog box.

f) Click** **_**Record user names**_

That's it!\
The user name field should now correctly show your staff names.
