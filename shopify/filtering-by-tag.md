You can filter reports by product tag, customer tag and order tag.

Let's walk through an example with product tags. The method is the same for customer tags and order tags.

a\) Click on _**Add filter**_

b\) Click the field named _**Product is tagged with**_

c\) A dialog box appears where you can search for the desired tag

![Search for any tag](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2863%29.png)

d\) Press OK. A filter is added that matches only rows for which the product is tagged with the chosen tag.

To switch to another tag, remove this filter and repeat the steps above.

Note that you can add multiple tag filters. For example, you might want to filter products that are tagged with both _Pants_ and _Summer_. Or, you could filter products that are tagged _Pants_ but **NOT** tagged _summer_.
