# Pickup and delivery orders (Zapiet)

Do you use the popular app [Store Pickup + Delivery](https://apps.shopify.com/click-and-collect) by Zapiet?\
It's a fantastic app that provides a solution for in-store pickup and local delivery.

The pickup and delivery information is recorded in multiple _Order attributes_, that can be displayed in reports.

You can add this data to your report by using the field search in the Edit screen and selecting "order attribute". Then you can select the required attribute from the drop-down.

{% hint style="info" %}
The _delivery date_ and _pickup date_ attributes are text fields. As a result, it's not possible to group by day/week/month or filter by date range. Our support team can help you create customized delivery date and pickup fields that work like proper date fields.\
