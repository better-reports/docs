# Historical inventory

A common request is showing historical inventory.

You might want to show your total inventory (quantity or valuation) as of the last day of the financial year, for accounting purposes.

Unfortunately, Shopify doesn't provide historical inventory data via its API. As a result, Better Reports cannot show historical inventory simply because it doesn't have the required data.

As a workaround, you could [schedule a report](../the-basics/scheduling-reports/) with your current inventory, set to run at the end of each month (or quarter). This way, you have a snapshot of all your month-end inventory for the year.
