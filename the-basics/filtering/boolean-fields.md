# Boolean fields

**Boolean** fields are also referred to as **Yes/No** fields, or **True/False** fields.

You can filter boolean fields with the **is** or **is not** operator.

For example, the filter below will match only the rows where the _Delinquent_ field has a value of 'Yes' (True).

Some fields let you choose the special value **Unknown**, which signifies that the row doesn't have any value. In other words, it matches rows for which the field's value is blank / empty / NULL.
