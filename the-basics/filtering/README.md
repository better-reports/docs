# Filtering

When viewing a report, you can apply filters to narrow down the report data.

When multiple filters are applied, they are **linked together via an implicit AND** relationship. In other words, **only rows that satisfy all of the filters** will match.

{% hint style="info" %}
When saving a report, existing filters are saved along with the report. As a result, when you load a report, some filters might already be preset. If you find yourself always tweaking the preset filters in a specific way, consider [duplicating the report](../../building-reports/creating-duplicating-reports/) and saving it with your own preset filters.
{% endhint %}

To add a filter, press the _**Add filter**_ \(1\) button.  
The _field selector_ \(2\) opens and you can select the field you want to filter by.

Depending on the selected field's type \(text, number, date, boolean\), different filtering options are presented.

You can remove any filter by pressing the gray cross directly on the right side of the filter.
