# Numeric fields

You can filter numeric fields with one of these operators:

* Equal
* Not equal
* Greater than
* Greater than or equal
* Less than
* Less than or equal
* Is unknown
* Is known

Simply choose an operator \(1\) and input a numeric value \(2\).

#### Is known / unknown operators

Use **is unknown** to show only rows for which the field doesn't have any value \(it is empty or NULL\). Similarly, use **is known** to show only rows that have a value.
