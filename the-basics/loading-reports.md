# Loading reports

The first tab in Better Reports is the [Reports page](https://app.betterreports.com/reports).

![The report page showing all built-in and custom reports for the selected connection](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2853%29.png)

It shows:

* The list of built-in reports \(1, 2\) for the selected connection \(4\)
* The list of custom reports \(3\) for the selected connection \(4\)

In the screenshot above, the connection selector \(4\) shows that the selected connection is _nitrocharts_, which is the name of our connected Shopify store.  
As a result, the built-in reports show the list of all Shopify reports that come out of the box \(1, 2\). They are organized in several groups, such as _Sales_ and _Transactions_.  
It also shows that we have a single custom report _Orders tagged for pickup_, located at \(3\) in the screenshot. Custom reports are reports that were created by a member of the team. They are private and are associated with a single connection.

To load the reports from another connection, switch to a different connection \(4\). The list of reports will change and show the reports associated with the selected connection.

If you belong to multiple organizations, you can also use the _organization selector_ to switch. The _connection selector_ \(4\) will change and show the connections associated with the chosen organization.
