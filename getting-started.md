**Note for Shopify users:** If you installed Better Reports directly from the [Shopify app store](https://apps.shopify.com/betterreports), a special shop account is created automatically for your store. You don't need to create a personal account.  [Find out more](shopify/#store-accounts)
{% endhint %}

## Connect your apps

To use Better Reports, you must connect to at least one app.

Go to [add connection](https://app.betterreports.com/settings/connections/add) and choose the app that you want to connect. Follow the authorization process, which is slightly different for each app (typically you just need to click a button to authorize access to Better Reports).

## Invite your team

Invite team members to join your organization. You can invite unlimited members for free. Members may either be _admin _or _member_, depending on required permissions.\
You can also create additional _organizations_. Each organization is a completely separate space, with its own members and its own data connections. Using multiple organizations is appropriate if you collaborate with different teams and/or if you need to assign different data permissions for different projects.
