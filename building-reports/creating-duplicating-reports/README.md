# Creating / Copying reports

You can either:

* Create a new report from scratch
* Tweak an existing report and save it as a new report

The latter approach is easier, but it requires having an existing report that is close enough to the desired report that you have in mind.

## Creating a report from scratch

1. Open the [Explore page](https://app.betterreports.com/designer)
2. Add desired fields, filters, sorting, subtotals, etc...
3. Click **Save** and provide a name for your report
